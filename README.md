# Zomato-Data-Analysis
Project 1
The Zomato Restaurant Data Analysis project involved extracting insights from Zomato restaurant data using a combination of Excel, SQL, Power BI, and Tableau. Here's a brief summary of the techniques and tools used:

Excel: Advanced functions like SUMIFS, COUNTIFS, PivotTables, and conditional formatting were employed to extract and analyze data. Additionally, functions like VLOOKUP, INDEX-MATCH, and DATE were used for data manipulation and extraction.


SQL: SQL queries were executed to extract relevant data from the Zomato dataset. Keywords such as SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, and ORDER BY were utilized, along with window functions and date functions for calculations and filtering.


Power BI: Interactive dashboards were created using Power BI. Features like data modeling, DAX formulas for calculations, and various visualizations such as tables, charts, and maps were employed. Slicers, filters, and drill-through functionality allowed for dynamic exploration of the data.


Tableau: Similar to Power BI, Tableau was used to create interactive dashboards. Techniques like data blending, calculated fields, dimensions, measures, and various visualizations were utilized. Filters and parameters enabled dynamic filtering of the data.


These tools and techniques provided valuable insights into restaurant industry trends related to location, opening trends, ratings, and price ranges, making the project a comprehensive resource for data analysis and visualization enthusiasts.
